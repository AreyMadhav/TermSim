simulation of shell written in cpp
what can be done with the following code:

1. Navigate Directories: You can use the cd command to change the current directory. The pwd command displays the current directory.

2. List Files and Directories: The ls command simulates listing files and directories in the current directory. (will make it dynamic soon)

3. Create Directories: The mkdir command simulates creating new directories.

4. Remove Files and Directories: The rm command simulates removing files and directories.

5. Copy Files and Directories: The cp command simulates copying files and directories.

6. Switch User: You can use su root to switch from the user to the root user. The prompt will change to indicate the change.

7. Simulate sudo apt install {package}: You can simulate the installation of a package using a command like sudo apt install package-name.

8. Simulate nmap (as of now can only simulate nmap -p- IP Address)

9. Exit: Typing exit terminates the simulation and ends the program.
